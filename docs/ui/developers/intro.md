# Overview

Currently, Millennium supports one main type of addons for the Steam Client: Themes. Themes serve as a way to add custom CSS into the Steam Client to change its appearance, remove clutter, or alter anything your heart desires!

## Themes

Themes are exactly what they sound like, there isn't much background information needed. Just like any other theme loader for an application, Millennium is intended to make it as easy as possible to make a theme.
